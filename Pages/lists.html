      <h1> Assignment to create Ordered and Unordered Lists</h1>
        <p> This is another template written up from scratch without looking at my notes about either the HTML or the workflow between CLI, Git, VS Code and Git Hub to make sure it all gets stored correctly and placed in the right order. </p>

        <ol type="A" reversed>
           <li>Step 1 create an HTML file in CLI called lists.html</li>
           <li>Step 2 git add the new file to staged</li>
           <li>Step 3 go into VS Code and write up template from scratch</li>
           <li>Step 4 Make sure code inclused DOCtype, meta charset and language</li>
           <li>Step 5 Input this content</li>
           <li>Step 6 save in VS Code</li>
           <li>Step 7 Get distracted by the kids having an issue about who has to marry the Stich doll vs the Ken doll... WTF</li>
           <li>Step 8 Try to gather thought process</li>
           <li>Step 9 Get lost with what to do next in the CLI? git add again or just git commit with a message saying edited?!?</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>    
            <li>Think this is enough content</li>
            <li>Going to wing-it on what to do next</li>
            <li>Can't believe I've not had to look at my notes yet!</li>
        </ul>
